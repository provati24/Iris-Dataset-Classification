# Iris Dataset Classification

This is a project to evaluate the performance of various models to perform classification task on the Iris dataset.

# Dataset Information

The data set contains 3 classes of 50 instances each, where each class refers to a type of iris plant. One class is linearly separable from the other 2; the latter are NOT linearly separable from each other.

**Attribute Information:-**

1. sepal length in cm
2. sepal width in cm
3. petal length in cm
4. petal width in cm
5. species: -- Iris Setosa -- Iris Versicolour -- Iris Virginica

The dataset can be downloaded from - https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/iris

# Algorithms

We fit the following models to the training set and evaluate them on the test set. The corresponding accuracy of each model is shown in the table below:

|        Model        | Accuracy (%) |
| ------------------- | :----------: |
| Logistic Regression |      91.1    |
| K-Nearest Neighbors |     100.0    |
| Decision Tree       |      91.1    |

Therefore, the best model accuracy is 100.0%.
